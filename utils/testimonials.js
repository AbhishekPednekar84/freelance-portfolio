      "MES Alumni Association website is a vibrant creation of the proud alumnus  Abhishek. He has taken a lot of interest in making it hassle-free and easy keeping in mind that the Institution is 65 years old and it has to be a simple process for every one. His attention on all details, patience in checking it innumerable times and answering all queries from the committee members is really appreciable. His timely response is a quality that I appreciate very much. With his eagerness to help his Alma Mater, he has done a fabulous job by creating an apt website for the MES Alumni Association.",

      "Excellent design and great use of colors. It was fresh and the feel of the website went well with our wedding theme. The website conveniently let us make a guest list, manage RSVPs, share all the details about our wedding right from a map that lead to our venue, to live streaming and quick view of the photos of previous functions. A great addition was the ‘Message us’ section, allowing guests and invitees to share their wishes since many of my friends and relatives couldn’t make it (COVID restrictions).",
